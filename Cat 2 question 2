hours_worked = float(input("Enter hours worked in a week: "))

Calculate gross pay
if hours_worked <= 40:
    grosspay = hoursworked * hourly_wage
else:
    regularpay = 40 * hourlywage
    overtimehours = hoursworked - 40
    overtimepay = overtimehours  hourly_wage  1.5
    grosspay = regularpay + overtime_pay

Calculate taxes
if gross_pay <= 600:
    taxes = gross_pay * 0.15
else:
    taxes = 600  0.15 + (gross_pay - 600)  0.20

Calculate net pay
netpay = grosspay - taxes
